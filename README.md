## Acknowledgments

 &nbsp; &nbsp; I was inspired by [Kinopoisk](https://www.kinopoisk.ru) project. This is a large Russian portal dedicated to films. I decided to create my own analogue of such a portal, well, only for books. \
 &nbsp; &nbsp; I know that similar projects already exist, well, I want to create my own creation.
